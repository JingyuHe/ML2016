I will use R in the classroom.
You will find some pointers on this page.

You can download R from [here](https://www.r-project.org/).

- [Install R for Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A56PD8BSS0A)
- [Install R for Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGkG7Gg6j0)

At the time of creating this webpage, the current version of R is **version 3.3.2**.

_Note: If you have R already installed on your computer, please make sure that
it is the latest version. Otherwise, you may encounter difficulties._

[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is a very useful interface for R.
You can download it from [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

### Additional resources

Many people are using R and you will often find a solution to your problem via Google.  
For example, [How to make a histogram in R](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=How+to+make+a+histogram+in+R).

Me, TA, and your classmates. Ask questions on the discussion board [Piazza](https://piazza.com/chicagobooth/spring2016/bus41000/home),
work together with your classmates, and answer other's questions.


### Python libraries
1. Install python on your computer from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

3. Install several necessary libraries for this course

    - pip, a Python packages manager [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
    
    - matplotlib, library for drawing plots [here](http://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)
    
    - sklearn, machine learning toolkit [here]( http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
    
    - scipy, scientific computing package [here]( http://scipy.org/install.html)
    
    - Jupyter, an interactive notebook for Python (like Rstudio to R) [here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
    
    - Ipython, an interactive terminal for Python [here](https://ipython.org/install.html)
